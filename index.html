  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>
    Progressive Enhancement is while we make websites for the new browsers, we don't leave the older browser users dry with sites with no/limited visible content. While it would be great if everyone upgraded to the latest and greatest browser when they came
    out as to make web developers happy, not everyone does. Just like how not everyone upgrades their car every year when the new model comes out, many people would rather stick with their browser they already have, it still works, right? The browser
    someone uses can be for many reasons, their company uses it so it just transfered over to their home life, it was what came with their laptop/desktop, or they've found certain websites that don't work quite right on other browsers. Whatever it is
    I don't think we should leave them behind, we need to keep making websites available for those older browsers, even if they're a little drab. In another example of keeping old browser support, the people who are in charge of marketing for a company
    wouldn't be happy if you told them people who have older browsers can't purchase from your website. In all Progressive Enhancement may be irritating to those in the new and know of web design but for the every day Joe they won't understand they have
    an old browser, they'll just think your website is subpar.

  <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    From the feedback, I learned that having Cyan over dark blue can cause issues for people who have a certain color blindness. My Mother pointed this out to me and we went to an online
    color checker and saw there were issues. I have since changed the Cyan color to a Pewter color to help aleviate the issue. I also had a few grammar errors that I addressed after
    getting her feedback, such as taking the colon off of the h2 in the home page and adding a period after the contact link on the FAQs page to be closer to my other pages. I put JavaScript into
    the document on the home page, the first set of photos should fade in and out. I chose Fade not only because it's the easiest, but because it's easy on the eyes and doesn't draw too much attention away from the rest of the document.</p>
  <p>
    Throughout the Semester I have learned how to make a rudamentary website. It won't be the prettiest but it'll be functionaly sound.
    Html looks hard when you first see it but as you learn what the tags do it becomes increasingly easier. CSS has its challenges but in all I believe I'm getting better each time I
    use it. JS still confuses me a bit but it's higher level for me. If I had to start over I would try and push myself to fill out the edges of the work to try and find ways that
    may be easier to do for me personally; definately spend more time playing around with photoshop, I had fun but don't think I'm as good with it as I could be if I gave it more time to
    adjust to it. From the cycle lab I learned to use JS if only a small amount, I was able to learn it enough to use it on my final draft Dragon project.

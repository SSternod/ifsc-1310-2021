     <h1>SSternod website Prototype</h1>
     <p>This Website is for an assignment in my ifsc-1310-01 class in the Fall 2021 term. It is generally going to look very rough, 
     as I have yet to master coding, but will get better and better as we procede through the year.</p>

     <h2>Where is this going?</h2>
     <h5>And why does it make no sense?</h5>
     <p>While I have no idea where I am going with the content, I know that the coding is going toward making this Site look decent and have content that is comprehisable.
     As previously said, <q><strong>[this Website] will get better and better as we procede</strong></q> 
     so currently as I'm writing this I'll have issues but they will be gone by the time this is due. The content is generally going to be off the top of my head as I type with no rhyme or reason.
     <div id="about">
         This website is for my class if ifsc 1310-01 at UALR. It's all over the place because again, I'm still new to coding; I feel like I'm doing alright. my name is Shawn, from the top of the page.

     <p>If I had to rank my favorite Music Genres it would be changing based on my mood but generally like the following.</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Metal</li>
       <li>Rap</li>
       <li>Rock</li>
       <li>Country</li>
       <li>Hip-Hop & R&B</li>
       <li>Pop</li>
     </ol>
     <dl>
       <dt>Why Hip-Hop is worse than Country</dt>
       <dd>while Hip-Hop has some big names, Country has the names of musicians like Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, Hank Williams, Hank Williams Jr, etc. 
       Who are just better in my opinion.</dd>
       <dt>Why Pop music is worse than Country</dt>
       <dd>Why are you even looking at this description? Pop is just <em>terrible</em>.</dd>

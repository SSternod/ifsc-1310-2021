     <h1>SSternod website Prototype</h1>
     <p>This Website is for an assignment in my ifsc-1310-01 class in the Fall 2021 term. It is generally going to look very rough, 
     as I have yet to master coding, but will get better and better as we procede through the year.</p>

     <h2>Where is this going?</h2>
     <p>While I have no idea where I am going with the content, I know that the coding is going toward making this Site look decent and have content that is comprehisable.
     As previously said, <q><strong>[this Website] will get better and better as we procede</strong></q> 
     so currently as I'm writing this I'll have issues but they will be gone by the time this is due.

     <p>If I had to rank my favorite Music Genres it would be changing based on my mood but generally like the following.</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Metal</li>
       <li>Rap</li>
       <li>Rock</li>
       <li>Country</li>
       <li>Hip-Hop & R&B</li>
       <li>Pop</li>
     </ol>
     <dl>
       <dt>Why Hip-Hop is worse than Country</dt>
       <dd>while Hip-Hop has some big names, Country has the names of musicians like Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, Hank Williams, Hank Williams Jr, etc. 
       Who are just better in my opinion.</dd>
       <dt>Why Pop music is worse than Country</dt>
       <dd>Why are you even looking at this description? Pop is just <em>terrible</em>.</dd>

       I recognize it's because I don't want to do it but it's hard to not get distracted. Random change. today is September 29th, 2021 and I start an Internship with AWCC. Mostly nervous 
       about the drive to be honest, I don't like driving in Little Rock.</p>

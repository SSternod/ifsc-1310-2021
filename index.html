  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>
    Progressive Enhancement is while we make websites for the new browsers, we don't leave the older browser users dry with sites with no/limited visible content. While it would be great if everyone upgraded to the latest and greatest browser when they came
    out as to make web developers happy, not everyone does. Just like how not everyone upgrades their car every year when the new model comes out, many people would rather stick with their browser they already have, it still works, right? The browser
    someone uses can be for many reasons, their company uses it so it just transfered over to their home life, it was what came with their laptop/desktop, or they've found certain websites that don't work quite right on other browsers. Whatever it is
    I don't think we should leave them behind, we need to keep making websites available for those older browsers, even if they're a little drab. In another example of keeping old browser support, the people who are in charge of marketing for a company
    wouldn't be happy if you told them people who have older browsers can't purchase from your website. In all Progressive Enhancement may be irritating to those in the new and know of web design but for the every day Joe they won't understand they have
    an old browser, they'll just think your website is subpar.
